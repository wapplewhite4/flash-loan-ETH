# flash-loan-ETH
A set of smart contracts for executing flash loan arbitrage trades on Ethereum. 

I wrote the FlashLoan.sol smart contract. Other files are necessary interfaces, libraries, and other dependencies. I would not recommend deploying this as it likely needs security upgrades, and has generally not been tested in the wild. Would like to deploy on a testnet once complete.
